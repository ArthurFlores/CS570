I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions. I wrote this code myself. This file should work perfectly
with anything you might throw at it.
I also put in an error. If getword() ever returns a -2 that means there was a
quote left open. I also wanted to note that I used if statements instead of a
switch statement because I feel more comfortable using if statements its seems
easier to read for me. Hopefully My documentation within the document is
satisfactory to read my code.
